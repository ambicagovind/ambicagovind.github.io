<b> I watch that pretty life play out in pictures from afar :) </b>


Hi! I am Ambica, a first-year graduate student at the [Department of Physics and Astronomy](https://www.physics.utah.edu/) at the University of Utah, my research focus being galaxies and cosmology. <br>
As a physicist, I am primarily interested in the several probes of late universe cosmology and subsequent tests of fundamental physics and cosmological models. I am also interested in the evolution of dark matter and baryons, and their connection to cosmic structure and expansion. <br>
As a programmer, I like to think about smart ways of dealing with big data in the field and newer, better methods of survey science and inference. Being a conservation enthusiast, a long standing goal of mine is to contribute in the development of efficient cosmological simulations. 

Before Utah, I graduated with my Bachelors in Engineering Physics from [Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad](https://physics.iith.ac.in/), where I had the opportunity to work on several exciting subjects. Under the guidance of [Prof. Shantanu Desai, IIT Hyderabad](https://iith.ac.in/phy/shantanud/), I tested modified gravity theories on a galaxy cluster. My Bachelors Projects, which focused on galaxies in cosmological simulations and dark matter distribution in spirals were supervised by [Dr. Gauri Sharma](https://ingauris.github.io/gsharma/) at the Astronomical Observatory of Strasbourg and [Prof. Paolo Salucci](https://www.sissa.it/ap/members.php?ID=134) at SISSA, Italy respectively. <br>
In the Summer of 2024, I received the [DAAD-WISE Scholarship](https://www.daad.in/en/2023/09/20/applications-invited-working-internships-in-science-and-engineering-wise-2023-24/) which gave me the opportunity to intern with [Prof. Daniel Gr√ºn](https://www.imprs-astro.mpg.de/content/prof-dr-daniel-grun-0.html) at [LMU Munich](https://www.physik.lmu.de/en/), where I worked on the optical follow-up of gravitational waves. I was also offered the [Caltech SURF Fellowship]([https://www.imprs-astro.mpg.de/content/prof-dr-daniel-grun-0.html](https://sfp.caltech.edu/undergraduate-research/programs/surf) in 2024. For a detailed description of my projects, awards and activities please refer to my [CV](https://ambicagovind.github.io/cv/).

Outside of work, I am an avid traveller (14/195), and I love to indulge in food, history, culture and architecture. I love poetry, I write mainly in English on my [blog](https://ambicagovind.blogspot.com/). My music taste spans from Sufi and Ghazals to Taylor Swift to [Falling in Reverse](https://fallinginreverse.com/) and [MCR](https://www.mychemicalromance.com/). I follow sports keenly, cheering for [Novak Djokovic](https://novakdjokovic.com/en/) and [Manchester City F.C.](https://www.mancity.com/)
