I am a fourth-year undergraduate pursuing a Bachelors in Engineering Physics with a Minor in Mathematics at the [Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad](https://physics.iith.ac.in/). My research interests lie in astrophysics and cosmology, where I have delved into topics such as stellar evolution, radioastronomy, galaxy formation and evolution, gravitational waves, transients, galaxy clusters and cosmology. <br>
For the past three years I have been working on clusters and cosmology under the guidance of [Prof. Shantanu Desai, IIT Hyderabad](https://iith.ac.in/phy/shantanud/). My Bachelors Projects, which focused on galaxies in cosmological simulations and dark matter distribution in spirals were supervised by [Dr. Gauri Sharma](https://ingauris.github.io/gsharma/) at the University of Western Cape and [Prof. Paolo Salucci](https://www.sissa.it/ap/members.php?ID=134) at SISSA, Italy respectively. <br>
This summer, I interned with [Prof. Daniel Grün](https://www.imprs-astro.mpg.de/content/prof-dr-daniel-grun-0.html), Chair of the Astrophysics, Cosmology and Artificial Intelligence(ACAI) Research Group at the [Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München](https://www.physik.lmu.de/en/), where I worked on the optical follow-up of gravitational waves. Apart from observational astrophysics, I also hold interests in physics topics such as cosmology, condensed matter theory and quantum mechanics. <br>
Last year, I received the Institute Academic Excellence Award for the highest grade point average in the academic year 2023-24. Additionally, I am a recipient of the [Caltech Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship(SURF)](https://sfp.caltech.edu/undergraduate-research/programs/surf) and the [DAAD-WISE Scholarship](https://www.daad.in/en/2023/09/20/applications-invited-working-internships-in-science-and-engineering-wise-2023-24/). To learn more about my work, feel free to explore my [CV](https://ambicagovind.github.io/cv/), [Research Interests](https://ambicagovind.github.io/research/) and [Courses](https://ambicagovind.github.io/courses/). My non-academic interests are here in the [Personal](https://ambicagovind.github.io/personal/) section.
