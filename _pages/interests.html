I get excited about a lot of things. 

<h2> Travel </h2>

I take great pride in having travelled to several countries, but travel is so much more than a checklist. I love to 
indulge in food, history, culture and architecture, learning about people and their ways all over the world. 
These are photos from the seaside in Colombo,the ruins at Pompeii and adorable penguins in South Africa! <br>

<h2> Sports </h2>
I love sports! Tennis was my first and favourite sport, but I also love football and Formula 1. 
I had the opportunity to visit Germany during the Euros 2024, and the public viewings were a blast! <br>

<h2> Literature </h2>
While language and wordplay are themselves immensely appealing, I also like how literature,
unlike science is sometimes open to interpretation in several ways. The same goes for art. I am quite fascinated by 
Surrealism and incorporate it in most of my works. Another outlet for my imagination is poetry,

I am a passionate fan of the heavy metal band Falling in Reverse, the tennis player Novak Djokovic and Manchester City F.C.

My personal causes are climate change and open science. <br>
I wish to be a responsible citizen and someday, I would like to live in a world where we progress science and tech 
without compromising our environment. In my field I would love to work in this direction by developing fast, energy-efficient
cosmological simulations. Teaching is a great passion of mine and I wish for every child in the world to be able to experience 
the sheer intellectual beauty of physics.
