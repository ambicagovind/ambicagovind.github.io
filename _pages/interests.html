I get excited about a lot of things.

<h2> Travel </h2>

I take great pride in having travelled to several countries, but travel is so much more than a checklist. I love to 
indulge in food, history, culture and architecture, learning about people and their ways all over the world. 
These are photos from the seaside in Colombo,the ruins at Pompeii and adorable penguins in South Africa! <br>

I love sports! Tennis was my first and favourite sport, but I also love football and Formula 1. 
I had the opportunity to visit Germany during the Euros 2024, and the public viewings were a blast! <br>

My music taste is usually rock and heavy metal! I adore the classics, Fleetwood Mac and Black Sabbath, occasionally drifting
into emo and folk rock. I write freestyle poetry in English, play badminton, sometimes sketch.
<br> 
My personal causes are climate change and open science. <br>
I wish to be a responsible citizen and someday, I would like to live in a world where we progress science and tech 
without compromising our environment. If simulations are a culprit, I'll start by optimising them!
