I get excited about a lot of things. 
<br>
<br>

A typical vacation is not resting at home but a hike or a road trip! Having visited nine countries and almost 
all parts of India, I love to indulge in tourism, food and culture. These are photos from the seaside in Colombo, Sri Lanka, 
the ruins at Pompeii, Italy and adorable penguins in South Africa!


Sports are a necessity. Tennis was my first and favourite sport, but I also love football and Formula 1. 
I had the opportunity to visit Germany during the Euros 2024, and the public viewings were a blast! 

My music taste is usually rock and heavy metal! I adore the classics, Fleetwood Mac and Black Sabbath, occasionally drifting
into emo and folk rock.
Surprise, I am also a mild Swiftie!
<br>
I write freestyle poetry in English, play badminton, sometimes sketch. 
My personal causes are climate change and open science. <br>
Someday, I wish to live in a world where we progress science and tech without compromising our environment.
