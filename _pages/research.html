<h2> Testing Modified Gravity Theories </h2> 

The inability of the Standard Model of Cosmology ΛCDM to explain a bunch of empirical galaxy scaling relations
and the surprising(?) ability of Modified Gravity Theories to explain them without invoking dark matter is a perplexing and fascinating problem to me. 
Inspite of these successes, these theories fail to explain the dynamics of the universe on the cluster scale, making them ideal testbeds for these theories.<br>
<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00707'>SD and I tested two of these theories</a> , MOND and Entropic Gravity on cluster scale using new eROSITA Data and found that MOND is indeed successful on a larger scale
but is afflicted with order of magnitude discrepancies closer to the cluster centre. Entropic Gravity on the other hand seems to explain the dynamical mass profile within 1σ. Modified Gravity is an active area of research in cosmology and more progress 
is anticipated both in theory(on relativistic scales) and observation, with the availability of high quality X-Ray Data. 

<h2> Galaxy Formation and Evolution </h2>

Broadly, I am interested in the role of N-body Simulations and semi-analytical models to understand the outcome of 
galaxy formation and evolution. My work with galaxies in the IllustrisTNG Simulation and the structure of dark matter halos have 
deepened my understanding of fine-tuning problems
in cosmology related to baryonic physics, as well as the broader questions with regard to the role of
the galaxy-halo connection. Having worked with
observations and simulation data, I see the intersection of numerical simulations 
and large scale surveys as the natural next step in my learning. 
I am also excited about the role of galaxies as a probe for constraining cosmology. Find my relevant work <a href='https://ambicagovind.github.io/projects/'>here</a>!

<h2> Cosmology and Large Scale Structure </h2>

I am eager to delve into the key areas of cosmology research: the Cosmic Microwave Background, Dark Matter and Dark Energy, Nucleosynthesis and 
Large Scale Structure Formation. Further, I am interested in leveraging both observation and theory to gain deeper insights. Some of the unsolved 
problems in ΛCDM such as the Hubble Tension and the σ<sub>8</sub> Tension are also subjects I would like to investigate in the future. Although my 
hands-on experience in this field is limited, I have developed a solid theoretical understanding of general relativity and cosmology,
which I am keen to build upon.

<h2> Multimessenger Astronomy </h2>

Motivated by results from GW170817, I am excited by the potential of a multimessenger approach to astronomical events 
and the wholesome perspective of the physical process that it promises to provide. I am interested in the detection of extragalactic transients-supernovae,
Tidal Disruption Events, Gamma-Ray Bursts etc, understanding their relationship with their host galaxies as well as the astrophysics involved. 
Another exciting pursuit is the electromagnetic follow-up of gravitational waves using various photometric/spectroscopic techniques. This was also the
subject of my <a href='https://ambicagovind.github.io/projects/'>internship</a>!
