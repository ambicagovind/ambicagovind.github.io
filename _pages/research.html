<h2> Testing Modified Gravity Theories </h2> 
<h5> [arXiv:1112.3960] </h5> 


The inability of the Standard Model of Cosmology ΛCDM to explain a bunch of empirical galaxy scaling relations
and the surprising(?) ability of Modified Gravity Theories to explain them without invoking dark matter is a perplexing and fascinating problem to me. 
Inspite of these successes, these theories fail to explain the dynamics of the universe on the cluster scale, making them the ideal testing entities for these theories.<br>
<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00707'>SD and I tested two of these theories</a> , MOND and Entropic Gravity on cluster scale using new eROSITA Data and found that MOND is indeed successful on a larger scale
but is afflicted with order of magnitude discrepancies closer to the cluster centre. Entropic Gravity on the other hand seems to explain the dynamical mass profile within $1\sigma$. This is an active area of research in cosmology and more progress 
is anticipated both in theory(on relativistic scales) and observation, with the availability of high quality X-Ray Data.

<h2> The Galaxy-Halo Connection </h2>
<h5> [arXiv:1804.03097] </h5> 

Motivated by studying galaxies from the IllustrisTNG Simulation and observations from various photometric/spectroscopic surveys during 
my Bachelors projects, certain questions intrigue me: 


<h2> Hubble Tension </h2> 
<h5> [arXiv:2109.01161] </h5>


There exists a 4-6σ discrepancy between the value of the Hubble Constant measured locally, using SNIa/Variable Star measurements as against
what was obtained from CMB Measurements by the Planck Satellite. Whether this indicates unknown systematics, or a beyond CDM Theory is still unknown. 
Although this is not something I have worked on myself, literature review and discussing with others in the field has piqued my interest in this 
problem and it is definitely something I would be interested in investigating in the future.
